## Description
**Rewardity** is a set of **well tested** tools which can help you to set up, manage and monitor **web3 rewards** for your dApp or **adapt existing web2** project. Add collection points or loyalty bonuses to your product with ease!

### Problem
* Quite a lot of the **existing web2** applications might have pretty standard reward or loyalty programs which they might like to **adapt for web3**. But effort for development might be quite high.
* You might need to make a **new dApp** but **don't want to extra spend effort** adding "yet another reward system".

## Architecture and used dependencies
